        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The combination of the egg and the aioli makes this burger special. 
            Grab a few napkins, it can get deliciously messy! When assembling the burger I recommend you spread the aioli on the bottom bun
            so the top bun is available for the egg.</p>
            
        <h3>Serves: 4 servings</h3>

            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>5 eggs, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 slices of sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
            <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>4 slices red onion, separated into rings</li>
            <li>4 tomato slices</li>
        </ul>  
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk mayonnaise, 1 large garlic clove, chipotle powder, and pinch of salt together in a small bowl; cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Place ground beef, 1 egg, seasoned bread crumbs, 2 garlic cloves, coriander, black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl; mix with your hands until just combined. Shape beef mixture into 4 patties.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook patties on preheated grill until browned on one side, about 6 minutes. Flip patties; continue grilling until no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Transfer burgers to a plate; top each burger with a slice of Cheddar cheese and cover plate tightly with foil.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Crack remaining eggs into skillet and immediately reduce the heat to low; season eggs with salt and pepper. Cook eggs until whites are set, about 2 minutes; add 1 tablespoon water to skillet, cover, and cook 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Spread about 1 tablespoon chipotle aioli on bottom of each hamburger bun; top each bun with 1 lettuce leaf, 1 onion slice, 1 tomato slice, and 1 burger. Add one egg to top of each burger; place top of hamburger bun over egg.</li>
        </ol>
