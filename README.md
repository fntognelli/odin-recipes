This is the first project in The Odin Project's Foundations course.
It consists of creating a webpage using HTML and add recipes.
In here there will be some recipes of my favorite dishes. 
DISCLAIMER: THESE RECIPES ARE NOT MINE. Every author is credited at the end of each recipe. I've used these recipes as if they were the "Lorem Ipsum..." text, to practice what I learned of html.
